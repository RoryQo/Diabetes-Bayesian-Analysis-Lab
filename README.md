# Diabetes-Bayesian-Analysis

#### Results
Using Monte Carlo simulation and plotting the distributions, we can see a significant difference between those with and without diabetes in all factors except `ped`. Those with diabetes have significantly higher blood pressure, glucose levels, bmis, and ages. Covariances between those with and without diabetes are all roughly equivalent. You can see this in the last figure, where they follow a linear line when plotted against each other.
